# [Bootstrap Spaceship - An ode to iOS](http://portugaldev.com/bootstrap-ios/)
Spaceship is an iOS inspired bootstrap theme that I made by modifying bootstrap's default variables.less with iOS colors and
my knowledge of what iOS apps look like. I was able to do this by reading the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/)
and picking colors from <http://ios7colors.com/>.<br />
In order to download this theme, you can either download the zip file from the dist folder in this Repo, or you can go to
<http://portugaldev.com/bootstrap-ios/> and click the download link.
